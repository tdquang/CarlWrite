The name of your project.-CarlWriteThe name(s) of your client(s).-Erik Warren & Kathy EvertzThe names of your team members.-Kyung Song, Quang Tran Dang, Anmol Raina, Danny LealA short (1-paragraph max) description of your project.-Our app primarily allows users to make and cancel appointments for the Writing Center. A user can make an appointment either by date or by tutor (if she has a preference for a specific tutor). The appointment is then stored and can be cancelled at any moment. A list of instructions to future developers on what they need to change to get the app ready for deployment. This may include brief descriptions of incomplete features, or the required attributes of a server, and anything else you think will show mercy to the people who handle your code in the future.-We have a few incomplete features we wanted to implement which include push notification and integration with the phone's calendar. Currently all the information is stored in the app. Once we integrate the app with the Carleton server we should be able to push and get information on the server. This will allow us to get data on tutors and to send emails to students. All the SQL code can be handled in the dataFile.swift and the rest of the project does not need to be touched.
