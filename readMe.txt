Description: Our app primarily allows users to make and cancel appointments for the Writing Center. A user can make an appointment either by date or by tutor (if she has a preference for a specific tutor). The appointment is then stored and can be cancelled at any moment. 

We have a few incomplete features we wanted to implement which include push notification and integration with the phone's calendar. Currently all the information is stored in the app. Once we integrate the app with the Carleton server we should be able to push and get information on the server. This will allow us to get data on tutors and to send emails to students. All the SQL code can be handled in the dataFile.swift and the rest of the project does not need to be touched.
